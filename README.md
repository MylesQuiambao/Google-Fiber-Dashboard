# Google-Fiber-Dashboard

## Project Background

This project uses anonymized data from Google Fiber, a telecommunications company, and aims to improve customer satisfaction, reduce call volume, and improve operational optimization. The dashboard that will be created must demonstrate an understanding of these goals and provide valuable insight for stakeholders about repeat caller volumes in different markets and the types of problems they represent.

### Objectives

- Understand how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand how effectively the team can answer customer questions the first time
- Provide insights into the types of customer issues that seem to generate more repeat calls
- Explore repeat caller trends in the three different market cities
- Design charts so stakeholders can view trends by week, month, quarter, and year.

### The Data

To anonymize and fictionalize the data, the datasets the columns market_1, market_2, and market_3 indicate three different city service areas the data represents.

The data also lists five problem types:

- Type_1 is account management
- Type_2 is technician troubleshooting
- Type_3 is scheduling
- Type_4 is construction
- Type_5 is internet and Wifi

Additionally, the dataset records repeat calls over seven-day periods. The initial contact date is listed as Day 0. The other call columns are “Day (#)” where # of days since the first call. For example, Day 6 indicates six days since the first contact.
